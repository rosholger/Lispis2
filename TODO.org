* Done
+ Arguments from C++. Lua style, ie stack based.
  (+ 1 2 3) becomes
  pushValue(vm, value(1));
  pushValue(vm, value(2));
  pushValue(vm, value(3));
  getGlobal(vm, symbol(vm, "+"));
  call(vm, 3);
+ Objects
  Do this before closures, bc closures will use them.
  I.E. symbol to symbol... Or maybe not?
  Should prob be symbol to ASTVariable instead
+ quote.
  + primitives
+ Convert parse tree into lists
+ Pretty printing for lists
  
* Todo
- Globals
- Objects
  - Replace with one built on top of DynamicVector
    map sucks
  - Parent
  - Array part
- multi-line printing of arrays
- Printing objects
- (better) string interning
  Will need hashing
- quote.
  - lists
    prob. just a call to a C function.
  - objects
- Move lambda from lexer to ast transformation
- quote et. al. abreviations
- Closures
  Lua style upvalues will be used.
- Globals
- Calling C++
- Lists, cons et. al.
- Macros
- let
- set!
- if
- for, maybe as iterators?
